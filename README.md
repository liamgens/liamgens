### About Me

I'm a full stack engineer who loves Python and JS. I also have quite a knack for infrastructure. Incoming full stack engineer @ [HomeAdvisor](https://www.homeadvisor.com/). Formally at [Peanut Butter](https://www.getpeanutbutter.com/) and [ACV Auctions](https://www.acvauctions.com/). In my spare time I rock climb and hike.
