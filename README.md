### About Me

I'm a full stack web developer who loves Python and JS. I also have a knack for infrastructure. I'm currently looking for work as a software engineer. Formally at [Peanut Butter](https://www.getpeanutbutter.com/) and [ACV Auctions](https://www.acvauctions.com/). In my spare time I rock climb and backpack.
