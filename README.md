### About Me

I'm a full stack engineer who loves Python and JavaScript. I also have quite a knack for infrastructure. Full Stack Engineer @ [Angi](https://www.angi.com/). Formally at [Peanut Butter](https://www.getpeanutbutter.com/) and [ACV Auctions](https://www.acvauctions.com/). In my spare time I rock climb and hike.
